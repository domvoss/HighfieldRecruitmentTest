# HighfieldRecruitmentTest
My Attempt at code for the Highfield recruitment test

If I had more time I'd develop the front end and back end seperately and make everything more robust but as a basic implementation of the assignement this does show all relevant data in a react front end so i have considered it done.
The front end has 3 navigable pages, one for unchanged user data, one for manipulated colour data and one for manipulated user age data.
